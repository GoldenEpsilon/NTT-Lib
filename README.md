# NTT-Lib
An all-encompassing library for NTT Mods


LibLoader.mod.gml is what you add into your mod to load lib, nothing else from the repo is required to be included with your mod (please load with correct capitalization to prevent shenanigans with multiple lib-loading mods at once)


libBoilerplate.mod.gml is the example code you should read to know how to load lib modules
